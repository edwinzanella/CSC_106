  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Edwin Hernandez-Zanella and I am a computer science major at the University of Rhode Island. I am enrolled in CS 106 and this page how I will test out and learn coding. I plan on graduated from University of Rhode Island with a Master's in Computer Science through the accerlated Master's degree program. After college, I plan on either becoming a software enginner or software developer. A few of my interests involve music, chess, and video games. I've been playing guitar for over two years, and I am joining clubs to help me find other people who have an interest in music.</p>
